<h1>Assignment - To-Do System (Backend)</h1>

The goal is to create a system to manage To-Dos which includes the following functions:
<ul>
<li> Add, remove or edit categories</li>
<li> Add, remove, edit To-Dos and assign them to one category</li>
<li> Search by objects</li>
<li> All data must be serializable/storable -> for this, please choose the format you prefer (data base, XML, JSON, etc.)</li>
<li> For every action, you must create end points that send the data to the clients. No logic should need to be present in the client.</li>
